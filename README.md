This repository includes two example programs:

**1. Wi-Fi Signal Scanner**
Scans nearby wireless signals and evaluates the signal strength of connected Wi-Fi networks.

**2. Home Assistant Integration**
Demonstrates how to use the XIAO ESP32C5 with Home Assistant.

The code is currently written for the Arduino IDE and is compatible out of the box. However, it can be adapted and ported to other development platforms as needed.
